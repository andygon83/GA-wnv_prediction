# West Nile Virus Prediction Group Project

This project is a submission for an old kaggle competition found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/

Using weather and testing data on different mosquito traps in the Chicago area, we build a prediction model with XGBoost to output the probability of the appearance of West Nile Virus.
